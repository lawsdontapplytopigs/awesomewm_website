# Hello and Merry Christmas r/unixporn !

(Had to repost because imgur converted the image to jpg)

In my quest to make my desktop even more awesome, I had to get familiar with the AwesomeWM widget API.

I want to have info about my computer (CPU usage, temperature, battery...) readily available but I don't want a busy panel.

Thus, I created a toggleable sidebar with all the info I need, as well as useful clickable widgets (volume control, music control, spawn htop, launch file manager, launch any app with rofi, logout).

Also I created an exit screen that can be used easily by both the keyboard and the mouse.

Now my desktop looks cleaner and is a lot more mouse friendly than before.
